## WDL workflows

- [minimap2](minimap2) to align two sets of sequences using minimap2 and return a gzipped .paf file. For example, an assembly vs a reference genome. 
- [bcftools_merge](bcftools_merge) to merge and normalize VCFs with SV calls using bcftools.
- [read_stats](read_stats) to compute simple stats for unmapped reads (e.g. length distribution, N50)
- [chimera_stats](chimera_stats) to estimate the amount of chimeric reads in a long-read dataset.
- [guppy_basecalling](guppy_basecalling) to basecall nanopore data (from fast5).
- [read_subset_qscore](read_subset_qscore) to subset a basecalled fastq by qscore.
- [align_stats](align_stats) to get identity stats from long reads.
