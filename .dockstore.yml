    description: Basecall a fast5 file using Guppy. This workflow was adapted from the scatterGuppy.wdl in the human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows repo (https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows/blob/master/data_processing/wdl/scatterGuppy.wdl). It was originally written by Jimin Park (jpark621@ucsc.edu).
